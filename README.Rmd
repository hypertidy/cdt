# cdt

The goal of cdt is to provide constrained Delaunay triangulation in R.


## Example

WIP, more soon

```{r example}
ct <- cdt:::load_cdt2d()
src1 <- "
//Then we define a list of points, represented as pairs of x,y coordinates
var points = [
  [-2,-2],
  [-2, 2],
  [ 2, 2],
  [ 2,-2],
  [ 1, 0],
  [ 0, 1],
  [-1, 0],
  [ 0,-1]
  ]
"
src2 <- "
//Next we can optionally define some edge constraints
// This set of edges determines a pair of loops
var edges = [
  //Outer loop
  [0, 1],
  [1, 2],
  [2, 3],
  [3, 0],
  
  //Inner loop
  [4, 5],
  [5, 6],
  [6, 7],
  [7, 4]
  ]
"

ct$eval(src1)
ct$eval(src2)
ct$eval("cdt2d(points, edges)")


x <- c(.1, .1, .9, .9, .2, .2, .8, .8)
y <- c(.1, .9, .9, .1, .2, .8, .8, .2)
geometry::delaunayn(cbind(x, y))
get_tri(x, y)
```
